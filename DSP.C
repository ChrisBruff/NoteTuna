// this file will be an outline of the DSP functions

// create buffers for data storage

//interupts

//sampling at 44.1 khz & incriment sample counter


// when enoguh samples have been made, do an fft


// once fft is done, figure out which afrequencies are ascociated with the top 5 peaks
// remad up on what the fft algorithum is going to output and if we are going to need to convert that to Hz
//or if we can figure out how to just use whatever comes out of it to do the calcs

// with those 5 highest peak frequencies, figure out which note is closest to a "known note"

//put that frequency in lookup table then output answer to GUI

// the best embedded systems are all interrupts with nothing in the main function
